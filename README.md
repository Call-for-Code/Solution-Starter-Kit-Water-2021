A template for Call for Code starter kits which help understand a real-world challenge under the Climate Change theme in 2021. These templates can be used to capture the output of the Design Thinking workshop in February and demonstrate a potential technology solution for that problem.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file. [Learn how to build apps on the IBM Cloud](#platform-development).
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text. [Learn about IBM artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence).
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language. [Learn about IBM artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence).
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage. [Learn about IBM data science](#data-science).

## Getting started

You can create a solution based on the proposed solution architecture above by exploring the following resources on the [IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/) site.
