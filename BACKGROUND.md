# Clean water and sanitation background information

## Overview

Water is the natural resource that is most threatened by climate change and a prerequisite for life on earth. From intelligent solutions for small farmers to recycling showers, technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption.

Three billion people throughout the world still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities at home, which are critical to preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. The number is much higher in least developed countries, where nearly three-quarters go without. ([UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1075412))

The impacts of COVID-19 could be considerably higher on [the urban poor living in slums](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060042), who don’t have access to clean water. [UN-Habitat](https://unhabitat.org/water-for-handwashing-in-slums-is-critical-to-prevent-covid-19-spreading) is working with partners to facilitate access to running water and [handwashing in informal settlements](https://unhabitat.org/over-135000-handwashes-at-un-habitat-supported-facilities-in-nairobi%E2%80%99s-informal-settlements).

[UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/agenda-for-action) is urgently [appealing for funding](https://www.unicef.org/appeals/covid-19) and support to reach more children with basic water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, especially those children who are cut off from safe water because they live in remote areas, in places where water is untreated or polluted, or because they are without a home, living in a slum or on the street.

## Statistics to consider

- 2 in 5 health care facilities worldwide have no soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub. (2016) ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- 1 in 4 health care facilities lack basic water services. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- Water scarcity could displace 700 million people by 2030. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- 40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030 coupled with a rising world population has the world careening towards a global water crisis. Recognizing the growing challenge of water scarcity, the UN General Assembly launched the [Water Action Decade](https://wateractiondecade.org/) on 22 March 2018, to mobilize action that will help transform how we manage water until 2028. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- More than 80% of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or seas without any pollution removal. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- Each day, nearly 1,000 children die due to preventable water and sanitation-related diarrheal diseases. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- Approximately 70% of all water abstracted from rivers, lakes, and aquifers is used for irrigation. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- Floods and other water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. ([UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/))
- By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water))

## Targets of [UN Sustainable Goal #6](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6)

- By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all 
- By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women, girls, and those in vulnerable situations 
- By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally 
- By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity, and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity 
- By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate 
- By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes 
- By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programs, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling, and reuse technologies 
- Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management

## How technology can help

1.	[The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/provide-food-and-water-sustainably/) states “Food demand is expected to increase by more than 50% in just the next 30 years as the world’s population continues to grow—it’s a challenge that can be met.” They plan on meeting this challenge by “Fostering innovations in technology, collaborating with communities to use resources more efficiently and promoting policies that enable sustainability. Together, we can secure healthy food and clean water for all people without sacrificing the environment.”

- The Nature Conversancy supplies fishers with electronic monitoring and promote fishing practices that reduce bycatch to help species recover while feeding the world. 

2.	IBM can provide various technologies such as IoT, Watson, and blockchain. Our [Smart Technology](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/water/) can monitor water resources in real time. Through a cloud-based Water Management as a Service platform, IBM is helping to improve the management of water resources.
- Can be used to create a database and interactive map to help locate and maintain the water points across the counties. ([View the map]()) 
- Can collect water usage, breakage, and repair data from boreholes that are monitored by SweetSense
- Can help deliver a detailed view of governance within each of the counties, associated responsibilities, and contact information

3.	[WaterBit](https://www.waterbit.app/) uses IoT technology to measure water saturation in the soil, manages irrigation, and helps ensure water isn’t overused on its crops. They have helped Devine Organic reduce their water use by 6% and decrease their greenhouse gas emissions (from fuel used for pumping water and truck trips to manually check the fields) by 5%. Additionally, Devine Organics has nearly doubled its asparagus harvest yield on the field since installing the sensors, by better managing irrigation throughout the growing season. The company says it has measured the increase from 800 to 1,500 pounds per acre. ([Hydrofinity](https://www.hydrofinity.com/blog/amazing-sustainable-water-technologies))

4.	Another IoT solution comes from [Banyan Water](https://banyanwater.com/), a provider of data-driven water conservation for enterprises, whose solution has saved more than 2.3 billion gallons of water since its inception in 2011. Banyan Water offers a technology solution for large users of water through a software platform that incorporates smart devices placed on a property. The devices remotely track and monitor how water is flowing outside a building or within a building. Using Banyan Water, in one year, apartment operator IMT Residential saved more than 47 million gallons of water across its 160-acre Riata community in Northwest Austin.

- WaterSeer
- The Janicki Omni Processor
- Variable Electro Precipitator

- Impact of wastewater on developed countries
“Most human activities that use water produce wastewater. As the overall demand for water grows, the quantity of wastewater produced, and its overall pollution load are continuously increasing worldwide.
In all but the most highly developed countries, the vast majority of wastewater is released directly to the environment without adequate treatment, with detrimental impacts on human health, economic productivity, the quality of ambient freshwater resources, and ecosystems.” ([ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2017-un-world-water-development-report-wastewater-untapped-resource))
